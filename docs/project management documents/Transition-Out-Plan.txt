1. EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
------------------------------------------
This plan describes how the E-Commerce Platform Control & Revenue Management System project will be transitioned smoothly and securely after completion. It ensures that all tools, data, and knowledge are transferred to the appropriate teams without disrupting operations.

The project developed a comprehensive e-commerce platform using Next.js 15, TypeScript, PostgreSQL, and Prisma ORM with role-based access control supporting five user types (Admin, Vendor, Customer, Finance Analyst, Operations Manager) to manage:
- Subscription management with tiered vendor plans (Basic, Premium, Enterprise)
- Commission tracking with automated calculations
- Product catalog and policy oversight with approval workflows
- Logistics coordination with real-time tracking
- Payout processing with automated transactions
- Role-specific dashboards and analytics for all user types

After completion, the project will transition from the development team to the operations and support units.
Estimated transition duration: 7 days after Go-Live (October 28 - November 4, 2025).

------------------------------------------
2. TRANSITION APPROACH
------------------------------------------
Steps include:
- Reviewing technical documentation, source code, configuration files, and user manuals for all eight sprint modules.
- Structuring project files for easy navigation with clear documentation for Next.js 15, TypeScript, PostgreSQL, and Prisma ORM architecture.
- Cleaning up outdated or duplicate data while preserving all business-critical information.
- Reviewing access permissions for all five user types (Admin, Vendor, Customer, Finance Analyst, Operations Manager).
- Creating a transition checklist including AWS credentials, database access, SSL certificates, GitHub repositories, and all documentation.
- Validating all automated workflows, commission calculations, and payout processes.
- Ensuring all role-based access control systems are properly configured and tested.

All materials will be verified and stored securely before knowledge transfer to ensure seamless operations and maintain the 162% ROI achievement.

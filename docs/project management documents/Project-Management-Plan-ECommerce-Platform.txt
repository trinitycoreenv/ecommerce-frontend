If a change is approved by the CCB, the project manager will update and re-baseline project documentation as necessary as well as ensure any changes are communicated to the team and stakeholders

Any team member or stakeholder may submit a change request for the project. The Product Owner, Maxine A. Delfin Decide, will chair the CCB and any changes to project scope, cost, or schedule must meet her approval. All change requests will be logged in the change control register by the Project Manager and tracked through to completion whether approved or not.

------------------------------------------
7. COMMUNICATIONS MANAGEMENT
------------------------------------------
This Communications Management Plan sets the communications framework for this project. It will serve as a guide for communications throughout the life of the project and will be updated as communication requirements change. This plan identifies and defines the roles of project team members as they pertain to communications.

The Project Manager will take the lead role in ensuring effective communications on this project. The communications requirements are documented in the Communications Matrix below. The Communications Matrix will be used as the guide for what information to communicate, who is to do the communicating, when to communicate it, and to whom to communicate.

**Project Team Directory:**
- Shiena Mae V. Conje – Scrum Master/Project Manager (₱95,000/month)
- Maxine A. Delfin Decide – Product Owner (20% time)
- Ronald Jay M. Literal – Senior Full-Stack Developer (₱85,000/month)

- UI/UX Designer – Contract (₱40,000/month × 3 months)
- Business Analyst – Contract (₱30,000/month × 2 months)

**Communications Conduct:**

**Meetings:**
The Project Manager will distribute a meeting agenda at least 2 days prior to any scheduled meeting and all participants are expected to review the agenda prior to the meeting. During all project meetings the timekeeper will ensure that the group adheres to the times stated in the agenda and the recorder will take all notes for distribution to the team upon completion of the meeting. It is imperative that all participants arrive to each meeting on time and all cell phones and devices should be turned off or set to vibrate mode to minimize distractions. Meeting minutes will be distributed no later than 24 hours after each meeting is completed.

**Email:**
All email pertaining to the project should be professional, free of errors, and provide brief communication. Email should be distributed to the correct project participants in accordance with the communication matrix above based on its content. All attachments should be in one of the organization's standard software suite programs and adhere to established company formats. If the email is to bring an issue forward then it should discuss what the issue is, provide a brief background on the issue, and provide a recommendation to correct the issue. The Project Manager should be included on any email pertaining to the project.

**Informal Communications:**
While informal communication is a part of every project and is necessary for successful project completion, any issues, concerns, or updates that arise from informal discussion between team members must be communicated to the Project Manager so the appropriate action may be taken.

------------------------------------------
8. COST MANAGEMENT
------------------------------------------
The Project Manager will be responsible for managing and reporting on the project's cost throughout the duration of the project. The Project Manager will present and review the project's cost performance during the monthly project status meeting. Using earned value calculations, the Project Manager is responsible for accounting for cost deviations and presenting the Product Owner with options for getting the project back on budget. All budget authority and decisions, to include budget changes, reside with the Product Owner.

For the project, control accounts will be created at the fourth level of the WBS which is where all costs and performance will be managed and tracked. Financial performance of the project will be measured through earned value calculations pertaining to the project's cost accounts. Work started on work packages will grant that work package with 50% credit; whereas, the remaining 50% is credited upon completion of all work defined in that work package. Costs may be rounded to the nearest peso and work hours rounded to the nearest whole hour.

Cost and Schedule Performance Index (CPI and SPI respectively) will be reported on a monthly basis by the Project Manager to the Product Owner. Variances of 10% or +/- 0.1 in the cost and schedule performance indexes will change the status of the cost to yellow or cautionary. These will be reported and if it's determined that there is no or minimal impact on the project's cost or schedule baseline then there may be no action required. Cost variances of 20%, or +/- 0.2 in the cost and schedule performance indexes will change the status of the cost to red or critical. These will be reported and require corrective action from the Project Manager in order to bring the cost and/or schedule performance indexes back in line with the allowable variance. Any corrective actions will require a project change request and be must approved by the CCB before it can be implemented.

Earned value calculations will be compiled by the Project Manager and reported at the monthly project status meeting. If there are indications that these values will approach or reach the critical stage before a subsequent meeting, the Project Manager will communicate this to the Product Owner immediately.

**Total Project Investment: ₱3,400,000 (July-October 2025)**

------------------------------------------
10. PROJECT SCOPE MANAGEMENT
------------------------------------------
Scope management for the E-Commerce Platform Control & Revenue Management System project will be the sole responsibility of the Project Manager. The scope for this project is defined by the Scope Statement, Work Breakdown Structure (WBS) and WBS Dictionary. The Project Manager, Product Owner, and Stakeholders will establish and approve documentation for measuring project scope which includes deliverable quality checklists and work performance measurements.

Proposed scope changes may be initiated by the Project Manager, Stakeholders or any member of the project team. All change requests will be submitted to the Project Manager who will then evaluate the requested scope change. Upon acceptance of the scope change request the Project Manager will submit the scope change request to the Change Control Board and Product Owner for acceptance. Upon approval of scope changes by the Change Control Board and Product Owner the Project Manager will update all project documents and communicate the scope change to all stakeholders. Based on feedback and input from the Project Manager and Stakeholders, the Product Owner is responsible for the acceptance of the final project deliverables and project scope.

The Product Owner is responsible for formally accepting the project's final deliverable. This acceptance will be based on a review of all project documentation, testing results, user acceptance testing results, and completion of all tasks/work packages and product functionality.

------------------------------------------
11. SCHEDULE MANAGEMENT
------------------------------------------
Project schedules for the E-Commerce Platform Control & Revenue Management System project will be created using modern project management tools starting with the deliverables identified in the project's Work Breakdown Structure (WBS). Activity definition will identify the specific work packages which must be performed to complete each deliverable. Activity sequencing will be used to determine the order of work packages and assign relationships between project activities. Activity duration estimating will be used to calculate the number of work periods required to complete work packages. Resource estimating will be used to assign resources to work packages in order to complete schedule development.

Once a preliminary schedule has been developed, it will be reviewed by the project team and any resources tentatively assigned to project tasks. The project team and resources must agree to the proposed work package assignments, durations, and schedule. Once this is achieved the Product Owner will review and approve the schedule and it will then be base lined.

In accordance with organizational standards, the following will be designated as milestones for all project schedules:
- Completion of scope statement and WBS/WBS Dictionary
- Base lined project schedule
- Approval of final project budget
- Project kick-off
- Approval of roles and responsibilities
- Requirements definition approval
- Completion of data mapping/inventory
- Project implementation
- Acceptance of final deliverables

**Roles and responsibilities for schedule development are as follows:**

The project manager will be responsible for facilitating work package definition, sequencing, and estimating duration and resources with the project team. The project manager will also create the project schedule and validate the schedule with the project team, stakeholders, and the Product Owner. The project manager will obtain schedule approval from the Product Owner and baseline the schedule.

The project team is responsible for participating in work package definition, sequencing, duration, and resource estimating. The project team will also review and validate the proposed schedule and perform assigned activities once the schedule is approved.

The Product Owner will participate in reviews of the proposed schedule and approve the final schedule before it is base lined.

The project stakeholders will participate in reviews of the proposed schedule and assist in its validation.

------------------------------------------
12. QUALITY MANAGEMENT
------------------------------------------
All members of the project team will play a role in quality management. It is imperative that the team ensures that work is completed at an adequate level of quality from individual work packages to the final project deliverable. The following are the quality roles and responsibilities for the project:

If any changes are proposed and approved by the Product Owner and CCB, the Project Manager is responsible for communicating the changes to the project team and updating all project plans and documentation.

------------------------------------------
13. RISK MANAGEMENT PLAN
------------------------------------------
The approach for managing risks for the E-Commerce Platform Control & Revenue Management System project includes a methodical process by which the project team identifies, scores, and ranks the various risks. Every effort will be made to proactively identify risks ahead of time in order to implement a mitigation strategy from the project's onset. The most likely and highest impact risks were added to the project schedule to ensure that the assigned risk managers take the necessary steps to implement the mitigation response at the appropriate time during the schedule. Risk managers will provide status updates on their assigned risks in the bi-weekly project team meetings, but only when the meetings include their risk's planned timeframe.

Upon the completion of the project, during the closing process, the project manager will analyze each risk as well as the risk management process. Based on this analysis, the project manager will identify any improvements that can be made to the risk management process for future projects. These improvements will be captured as part of the lessons learned knowledge base.

**Key Risk Categories:**
- Technical Risks: Integration issues with third-party APIs, cloud infrastructure problems

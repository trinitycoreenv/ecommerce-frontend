This document confirms the formal acceptance of the **E-Commerce Platform Control & Revenue Management System** project.

The project has successfully delivered a comprehensive e-commerce platform using Next.js 15, TypeScript, PostgreSQL, and Prisma ORM with role-based access control supporting five user types (Admin, Vendor, Customer, Finance Analyst, Operations Manager) that addresses challenges in:

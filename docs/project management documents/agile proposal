Project Title
E-COMMERCE PLATFORM CONTROL & REVENUE MANAGEMENT SYSTEM

---

Project Overview
This project aims to develop a comprehensive e-commerce platform that will serve as the central hub for all business operations. The system will support five different types of users (Administrators, Vendors, Customers, Finance Team, and Operations Team) with customized dashboards and features for each role. The platform will help manage vendor subscriptions, calculate commissions automatically, approve products, track shipments, process payments, and generate business reports. This will eliminate manual processes, reduce errors, and provide real-time visibility into all business operations.

---

Project Objectives
- Create a subscription system where vendors can choose from three different plans (Basic, Premium, Enterprise) with automatic commission calculations.  
- Build a product catalog where vendors can add products that go through an approval process before being published.  
- Set up shipping and delivery tracking that works with logistics partners to provide real-time updates to customers.  
- Automate payment processing and vendor payouts with detailed transaction records and financial reports.  
- Design custom dashboards for each user type showing relevant information and key performance indicators.  
- Ensure the system is secure with proper login controls and user permissions based on their role in the business.

Scope of Work

1. Requirements Gathering (Backlog Creation)  
- Meet with all five user types (Administrators, Vendors, Customers, Finance Team, Operations Team) to understand their needs.  
- Create a prioritized list of features and requirements based on what each user type needs to do their job effectively.  
- Document all business processes and workflows that need to be automated or improved.  

2. Sprint Planning  
- Break down the feature list into manageable 2-week work periods called "sprints".  
- Define clear goals for each sprint and what will be delivered to users.  
- Assign specific tasks to team members and set realistic timelines for completion.  

3. Development (Iterative)  
- Build the system features in 2-week cycles, delivering working functionality each time.  
- Create and test each part of the system to ensure it works properly and securely.  
- Conduct thorough testing to make sure users can only access what they're supposed to see.  

4. Daily Stand-ups  
- 15-minute daily meetings to track progress.  
- Identify blockers and reassign tasks if needed.  
- Update sprint board and backlog.  

5. Sprint Review  
- Demonstrate completed features to stakeholders.  
- Collect feedback and adjust backlog accordingly.  
- Validate sprint goals against deliverables.  

6. Sprint Retrospective  
- Discuss team performance and collaboration.  
- Identify process improvements.  
- Apply lessons learned to next sprint.  

7. Final Deployment  
- Conduct final system testing and quality assurance.  
- Deploy the system to the production environment.  
- Monitor system performance after launch.  

8. Training and Support  
- Create user manuals and training videos for all five user roles.  
- Conduct onboarding sessions for Admin, Vendors, Customers, Finance Analysts, and Operations Managers.  
- Provide ongoing support and maintenance with focus on system performance and security updates.

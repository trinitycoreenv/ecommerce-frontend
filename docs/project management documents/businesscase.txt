QUEZON CITY, PHILIPPINES 1123

DATE: JULY 1, 2025

1. EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
This business case outlines the strategic initiative to implement the Core Transaction 3: Platform Control & Revenue Management System within our e-commerce ecosystem. The system is designed to address inefficiencies in subscription handling, commission tracking, product policy enforcement, logistics coordination, financial transactions, and reporting.

The proposed solution will centralize control, automate workflows, and provide real-time insights across key operational areas. This document details the business problem, anticipated outcomes, recommended approach, justification, and cost-benefit analysis to support project approval and execution.

1.1. Issue
The current e-commerce platform lacks a unified system for managing vendor subscriptions, commission structures, product compliance, logistics coordination, and financial transactions. These fragmented processes result in:
- Inconsistent commission deductions and vendor disputes
- Manual product listing approvals and policy enforcement delays
- Poor shipment tracking and delivery performance metrics
- Inefficient payout processing and financial reconciliation
- Lack of centralized reporting and KPI visibility

These issues hinder scalability, reduce vendor satisfaction, and increase operational overhead.

1.2. Anticipated Outcomes
Implementing the Platform Control & Revenue Management System will:
- Centralize subscription and commission management with automated calculations
- Streamline product catalogue oversight and enforce compliance policies
- Optimize logistics partner coordination and shipment tracking
- Automate vendor payouts and transaction reconciliation
- Provide real-time dashboards and customizable reports for decision-making

1.3. Recommendation
Develop and deploy a comprehensive e-commerce platform using modern technologies (Next.js 15, TypeScript, PostgreSQL, Prisma ORM) with role-based access control supporting five user types:
- Subscription and commission management with tiered vendor plans (Basic, Premium, Enterprise)
- Product catalogue and policy oversight with approval workflows
- Shipment and logistics configuration with real-time tracking
- Payout and transaction management with automated processing
- Role-specific dashboards and reports for all user types (Admin, Vendor, Customer, Finance Analyst, Operations Manager)

Benefits include:
- Automated commission deductions with real-time calculations
- Real-time shipment tracking and logistics partner integration
- Transparent transactions and payouts with comprehensive audit trails
- Centralized policy enforcement and automated alerts
- Interactive dashboards with exportable reports tailored to each user role

1.4. Justification
The proposed system aligns with strategic goals of efficiency, vendor empowerment, and revenue optimization.
- Highest ROI via automation
- Lowest risk via internal modular development
- Fastest implementation via Agile sprints

Quantitative benefits:
- 20% reduction in vendor support tickets
- 30% improvement in payout processing
- 15% increase in subscription revenue
- 25% fewer policy violations

Failure to implement will result in continued inefficiencies and lost opportunities.

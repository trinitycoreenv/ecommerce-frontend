DATE: JULY 1, 2025

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
The E-Commerce Platform Control & Revenue Management System project is a comprehensive initiative to develop a modern, scalable e-commerce platform using Next.js 15, TypeScript, PostgreSQL, and Prisma ORM. The system will support five distinct user roles (Admin, Vendor, Customer, Finance Analyst, Operations Manager) with role-based access control and automated workflows.

- The project will deliver eight core modules across 8 sprints:
  - Sprint 1: Foundation & Infrastructure Setup
  - Sprint 2: User Management & Authentication System
  - Sprint 3: Product Catalog & Approval Workflows
  - Sprint 4: Order Management & Payment Processing
  - Sprint 5: Subscription & Commission Management
  - Sprint 6: Logistics & Operations Management
  - Sprint 7: Analytics & Reporting Dashboards
  - Sprint 8: Testing, Deployment & Launch

These modules will streamline platform monetization, improve vendor transparency, and provide real-time insights for all user types. The Agile development approach ensures continuous improvement, stakeholder feedback integration, and scalable system growth with 162% ROI and 4.6-month payback period.

PROJECT PURPOSE/JUSTIFICATION
The E-Commerce Platform Control & Revenue Management System project is designed to address critical operational challenges within the current e-commerce platform. As the platform scales, the lack of centralized control and automation in revenue-related functions has led to inefficiencies such as delayed transactions, manual errors, and limited financial visibility. These issues negatively impact vendor satisfaction and hinder growth.

The purpose of this project is to develop a comprehensive, modern e-commerce platform that introduces robust and transparent systems for managing all core business operations, including subscription management, commission tracking, product oversight, logistics coordination, payout processing, and platform monetization. By implementing automated workflows and real-time reporting, the platform will improve accuracy, reduce operational overhead by 25%, and support informed decision-making.

This initiative is critical to meeting the increasing demands of vendors and stakeholders who expect seamless operations and data-driven transparency. The ₱3,400,000 investment will deliver ₱8,900,000 in annual benefits, achieving 162% ROI in the first year. It will also support the business in maintaining regulatory compliance, enhancing trust, and ensuring long-term scalability with support for 10,000+ concurrent users and 100,000+ products.

BUSINESS NEED/CASE
The current platform lacks centralized control and automation for revenue-related operations. Manual processes lead to delays, errors, and vendor dissatisfaction. This project addresses those gaps by introducing structured workflows and real-time reporting.

Key Drivers:
- Market Demand: Vendors expect transparent and automated financial workflows.
- Organizational Need: Improve platform monetization and reduce manual overhead.
- Vendor Requests: Simplify subscription management and payout tracking.
- Technological Advancement: Enable real-time tracking and automated reporting.
- Strategic Alignment: Supports the goal of becoming a scalable and vendor-friendly platform.

Expected Benefits:
- Automated commission and payout processing
- Improved vendor satisfaction and retention
- Reduced manual workload for admins and finance teams
- Enhanced visibility into platform revenue and performance

BUSINESS OBJECTIVES
- Centralize platform control for subscriptions, commissions, and payouts with automated calculations
- Automate financial workflows and reduce errors by 95% through systematic processes
- Improve vendor transparency and engagement with real-time dashboards and notifications
- Provide role-specific reporting and KPI dashboards for all five user types
- Support scalable expansion with cloud infrastructure handling 10,000+ concurrent users
- Achieve 162% ROI in first year through increased revenue and reduced operational costs
- Reduce manual processes by 25% and improve payout processing speed by 40%

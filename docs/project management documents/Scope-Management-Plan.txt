INTRODUCTION
------------------------------------------
The Scope Management Plan defines, manages, and regulates the project's scope to ensure all required work is completed efficiently within the ₱3,400,000 budget and July-October 2025 timeline, while avoiding unnecessary tasks. This plan helps identify and confirm specific project needs, verify deliverables, and manage scope changes.

The goal is to develop a comprehensive e-commerce platform using Next.js 15, TypeScript, PostgreSQL, and Prisma ORM with role-based access control supporting five user types (Admin, Vendor, Customer, Finance Analyst, Operations Manager). The system will automate subscriptions, commissions, logistics, policies, and payouts, ensuring transparency, control, and productivity in e-commerce operations while achieving 162% ROI and 4.6-month payback period.

------------------------------------------
SCOPE MANAGEMENT APPROACH
------------------------------------------
The project scope will be managed through a structured and organized process:
- The Project Manager will oversee scope definition, monitoring, and updates.
- The scope will align with the approved project charter and business case.
- Deliverables will be verified against the official scope statement.
- Any changes must be documented, reviewed, and approved by authorized members.

Scope management meetings will be held after each sprint to review progress, verify deliverables, and ensure all work aligns with approved requirements. This prevents unnecessary work and maintains alignment with stakeholder expectations.

------------------------------------------

SCOPE DEFINITION
------------------------------------------
The project scope is defined through analysis of the business case, objectives, and stakeholder feedback. The goal is to build a comprehensive e-commerce platform using Next.js 15, TypeScript, PostgreSQL, and Prisma ORM with role-based access control supporting five user types, including:

------------------------------------------
SCOPE VERIFICATION
------------------------------------------
Scope verification ensures deliverables meet project requirements before acceptance.

- The Project Manager and Product Owner review each module for compliance.  
- The Scrum Master records approvals and maintains documentation.  
- Acceptance occurs after every sprint for continuous improvement.  
- Regular reviews promote transparency and early issue resolution.  
- Verified deliverables ensure system quality and stakeholder satisfaction.

------------------------------------------
SCOPE CONTROL
------------------------------------------
Change requests must be documented via the **Change Request Form** and submitted to the Project Manager.

Steps for scope control:
- Evaluate impact on schedule, cost, and resources.  
- Coordinate with Product Owner and stakeholders for approval.  
- Update scope statement, schedule, and WBS upon approval.  
- Maintain project logs for transparency.  
- Prevent scope creep by disallowing unauthorized changes.  

The primary goal is to ensure all project work aligns with approved deliverables and objectives.

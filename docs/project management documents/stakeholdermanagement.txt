------------------------------------------
1. INTRODUCTION
------------------------------------------
This strategy outlines the approach for identifying, analyzing, and managing stakeholders for the E-Commerce Platform Control & Revenue Management System project. Effective stakeholder management is crucial for the success of this comprehensive e-commerce platform development using Next.js 15, TypeScript, PostgreSQL, and Prisma ORM. The system will support five user types (Admin, Vendor, Customer, Finance Analyst, Operations Manager) with role-based access control, automated workflows, and real-time dashboards.

The strategy will identify and classify stakeholders, determine their power, interest, and influence, and establish appropriate management and communication approaches. This systematic approach allows the project to engage key stakeholders throughout its lifecycle, gain feedback, and ensure smooth implementation.

Early identification and proactive communication with stakeholders is essential to manage interests that may be positively or negatively affected by system automation and policy changes. Continuous engagement ensures objectives are achieved effectively.

------------------------------------------
2. IDENTIFY STAKEHOLDERS
------------------------------------------
The project team will conduct stakeholder identification sessions in multiple phases to ensure all internal and external stakeholders are recognized and engaged.

Phases of stakeholder identification:
- Phase 1: Internal Technical Stakeholders – IT operations, database admins, security teams, developers, QA personnel, and system admins.
- Phase 2: Internal Business Stakeholders – finance, administrative staff, product managers, and executives.
- Phase 3: External Vendor Stakeholders – platform vendors affected by subscription management and policy enforcement.
- Phase 4: External Partner Stakeholders – logistics partners, payment processors, compliance auditors, and third-party integrations.

Criteria for stakeholder identification:
- Will the person or organization be directly or indirectly affected by the system?
- Can they influence project success, approve resources, or affect integration?
- Do they provide funding, technical expertise, or testing capabilities?
- Do they have special skills or domain knowledge critical to success?
- Do they benefit from or resist the proposed system improvements?

------------------------------------------
3. KEY STAKEHOLDERS
------------------------------------------
Key stakeholders include those with authority over policy, commission, product catalogues, logistics, financial transactions, and system integration.

The Project Manager will:
- Develop individualized engagement plans.
- Gather stakeholder preferences for communication frequency and feedback.
- Identify concerns and manage conflicting interests.
- Include key stakeholders in steering committees, reviews, UAT, and milestone meetings.

This ensures collaboration, transparency, and accountability across project activities.

------------------------------------------
4. STAKEHOLDER ANALYSIS
------------------------------------------
Stakeholders will be analyzed based on their organizational roles and levels of power, influence, and interest. The Mendelow Power/Interest Matrix will be used to assess engagement strategies.

Each stakeholder receives a score for:
- Power (1-5): degree of influence.
- Interest (1-5): degree of engagement.

Stakeholder key (bullet-point form replacing table):
- A: Senior Full-Stack Developer – Ronald Jay M. Literal (₱85,000/month) (Power 4, Interest 5)
- B: Full-Stack Developer – Alghazi E. Utap (₱70,000/month) (Power 3, Interest 5)
- C: Scrum Master/Project Manager – Shiena Mae V. Conje (₱95,000/month) (Power 5, Interest 5)
- D: Product Owner – Maxine A. Delfin Decide (20% time) (Power 5, Interest 5)
- E: QA Engineer – Mike Jaspher D. Pasion (₱55,000/month) (Power 3, Interest 5)
- F: DevOps Engineer – Jonathan S. Gatase (₱65,000/month) (Power 4, Interest 4)
- G: UI/UX Designer – Contract (₱40,000/month × 3 months) (Power 3, Interest 4)
- H: Business Analyst – Contract (₱30,000/month × 2 months) (Power 3, Interest 4)

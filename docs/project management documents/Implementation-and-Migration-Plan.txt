1. PURPOSE
------------------------------------------
The purpose of this Implementation and Migration Plan is to outline the deployment and transition of the E-Commerce Platform Control & Revenue Management System project into operation. This plan details the implementation and migration steps, as well as the specific requirements and responsibilities for all involved teams.

Goal:
Ensure all stakeholders are aware of the project's requirements, responsibilities, and expectations to achieve a successful deployment and migration to the operational group. The ₱3,400,000 investment will deliver ₱8,900,000 in annual benefits, achieving 162% ROI in the first year with a 4.6-month payback period.

Any changes to this plan must follow the project's change control process for review and approval before being implemented.

------------------------------------------
2. DESCRIPTION OF IMPLEMENTATION
------------------------------------------
The E-Commerce Platform Control & Revenue Management System project enhances the e-commerce platform's operations using Next.js 15, TypeScript, PostgreSQL, and Prisma ORM with role-based access control supporting five user types (Admin, Vendor, Customer, Finance Analyst, Operations Manager) by automating and centralizing control over vendor subscriptions, commissions, and financial transactions.

Implementation steps:
1. Staging Environment Deployment:
Deploy the complete system (all eight sprint modules) to a staging environment for testing.
   - Sprint 1: Foundation & Infrastructure Setup
   - Sprint 2: User Management & Authentication System
   - Sprint 3: Product Catalog & Approval Workflows
   - Sprint 4: Order Management & Payment Processing
   - Sprint 5: Subscription & Commission Management
   - Sprint 6: Logistics & Operations Management
   - Sprint 7: Analytics & Reporting Dashboards
   - Sprint 8: Testing, Deployment & Launch

2. Internal Testing and Integration:
Conduct internal testing and bug fixes to ensure secure integration with AWS cloud infrastructure and existing systems.

3. User Acceptance Testing (UAT):
All five user types (Admin, Vendor, Customer, Finance Analyst, Operations Manager) validate automated workflows and real-time KPI reporting on role-specific dashboards.

4. Final Deployment:
Deploy the project to the production environment upon UAT completion and stakeholder approval with support for 10,000+ concurrent users.

5. Post-Launch Support:
Provide immediate issue resolution and submit a final report within 30 days of launch with 162% ROI validation.
